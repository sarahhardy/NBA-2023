## Currently active foreign talent
### How many currently active players came to the NBA from a country other than the USA?
SELECT count(*) AS count_players<br>
FROM common_player_info AS cpi<br>
INNER JOIN player AS p<br>
	            &emsp; ON cpi.person_id = p.id<br>

ORDER BY nba_years DESC<br>
;<br>

**Results:** Kyrie Irving from Australia,who has been playing in the NBA for 11 years, is the foreign player who has been playing the longest.

# Traded Players
## How many players played for more than one team during the 2022-2023 season?

SELECT count(*) as count_teams, player_name<br>
FROM player_stats AS ps<br>
GROUP BY player_name<br>
HAVING count(*) > 1<br>
ORDER BY count_teams DESC, player_name<br>
;<br>

**Result:** 70 players played for 2 teams during the 2022-2023 season. No players played for 3 teams.
The complete list of all 70 players can be found in  [traded_players.csv](traded_players.csv).

## What were the positions of the traded players?

SELECT pos, count(*) as count_position<br>
 FROM<br>
&emsp;	(<br>
&emsp;		SELECT count(*) AS count_teams, <br>
&emsp;&emsp;				   player,pos <br>
&emsp;		FROM player_stats <br>
&emsp;		GROUP BY player <br>
&emsp;		HAVING count(*) > 1 <br>
&emsp;		ORDER BY count_teams DESC <br>
&emsp;	) <br>
GROUP BY pos <br>
; <br>

**Result:** Positions of the traded players are fairly evenly distributed, with point guards and shooting guards being traded slightly more often than other positions.

## Which teams did the players who played for more than one team in 2022-2023 play for?

Note: Each team the player played for is included. There are 70 players that each played for two teams and 140 rows generated by this query.

SELECT player, tm <br>
FROM player_stats <br>
WHERE player IN <br>
&emsp;	( <br>
&emsp;SELECT player <br>

ORDER BY player <br>
;<br>
**Result:** Dataset idenitifying both teams the 70 traded players played for:  [traded_players_with_teams.csv](traded_players_with_teams.csv).<br>


## How many teams were involved in midseason trades? Which team had the most traded players on their roster?
Note: Any one trade tranaction will result in 2 or more players on the roster involved in a trade. Trades in this output refers to traded players on the roster, not to trade transactions.
     
SELECT team.full_name,<br>
&emsp;       abbreviation,<br>

&emsp;	&emsp;			) <br>
		GROUP BY tm) AS trades <br>
ON trades.tm = team.abbreviation <br>
ORDER BY count_trades DESC <br>
; <br>

**Results:** 27 of the 30 team were involved in a trade. The Los Angeles Lakers, with 13 traded players on their roster, had the most traded players. A complete listing with all 30 teams can be found in the next query.

### Query that returns all 30 teams with a count of how many players on their 2022-23 roster were traded during the season and the team's regular season winning percentage.

Note: Any one trade will result in 2 or more players on the roster involved in a trade. This query returns all 30 teams, including 3 that did not make trades. For these 3 teams, count_trades is originally NULL, but the NULL is replaced
with a zero.

SELECT team.full_name,<br>
&emsp;       abbreviation,<br>
&emsp; 	   ts.WIN_pct,<br>
&emsp;	   -- Replace the NULLs with zeros for the teams that had no trades<br>
&emsp;	  ifnull(trades.count_teams,0) AS count_trades	<br>
FROM team<br>
LEFT OUTER JOIN (<br>
&emsp;		SELECT count(*) AS count_teams,<br> 
&emsp;	&emsp;			   ps.tm,<br>
&emsp;	&emsp;			   team.full_name <br>
&emsp;		FROM player_stats AS ps <br>
&emsp;		INNER JOIN team <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;			ON team.abbreviation = ps.tm <br>	
&emsp;		WHERE ps.player IN <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;			(SELECT player <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;				 FROM <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;					( <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;	&emsp;				SELECT count(*) AS count_teams, player <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;	&emsp;					FROM player_stats <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;	&emsp;						GROUP BY player <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;	&emsp;						HAVING count(*) > 1 <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;	&emsp;						ORDER BY count_teams DESC <br>
&emsp;	&emsp;	&emsp;						)
&emsp;	&emsp;			) <br>
		GROUP BY tm) AS trades <br>
ON trades.tm = team.abbreviation <br>
INNER JOIN team_stats AS ts -- Add in team_stats to get WIN_pct <br>
ON ts.abbreviation = team.abbreviation
ORDER BY count_trades DESC <br>
; <br>

**Result:** There is no obvious relationship between number of trades and winning percentage, but this winning percentage includes games before and after the trade was made and also does not include playoff games. Note that the NBA 2023 champions, the Denver Nuggets, had the 4th highest win percentage and 4 traded players which was the median number of trades. Their opponents in the championship game, the Miami Heat, had the 13th highest winning percentage and also had 4 traded players. the complete results ordered by number of trade players can be found in   [team_trades_and_winpts.csv](team_trades_and_winpts.csv) and ordred by winning percentage in  [team_winpts_and trades.csv](team_winpts_and_trades.csv).<br>
